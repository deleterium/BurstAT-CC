# Built-in functions
Since version 2.0 many built-in functions were added.
Some functions have a version to handle fixed point numbers, in special the ones to handle Signa balance.
When using the fixed point to Signa, the values are straigth-forward as used in wallets and show in block explorer, they can have up to 8 decimals.
But using the long values version, the Signa balance are handled as NQT values (1 NQT = 0.00000001 Signa).
When handling assets, all values are expressed as QNT. 1 QNT is the least quantity of asset and depends on the decimals. If decimals is set to 4, 1 QNT is 0.0001 assets.

## Handling transactions loop
</summary>

### getNextTx
* Prototype:
`long getNextTx();`
* Description:
Keep track of incoming transactions and returns the next transaction Id.
If there is no new transaction, zero is returned.
A internal variable '_counterTimestamp' is used to store the last transaction received and it is updated by this function.
* Note:
If it is needed to come back to a given transaction later on, it is possible to save the contents of auto counter to another variable minus one. Later just overwrite the auto counter and then call `getNextTx` function. In this way it is possible to loop again thru all messages starting at that giving point. Example:
```c
// Save current loop point
currrentTransaction = getNextTx();
rewindPoint = _counterTimestamp - 1;
// ...

// Restore loop point
_counterTimestamp = rewindPoint;
currrentTransaction = getNextTx();
// currrentTransaction will be the same from save point
// and all messages after that one can be visited again.
```

### getNextTxFromBlockheight
* Prototype:
`long getNextTxFromBlockheight(long blockheight);`
* Description:
Returns the transaction Id of the first transaction received at block 'blockheight' or later.
If there is no transaction, zero is returned.
This function also sets the internal variable '_counterTimestamp' and can be used together `getNextTx`.

### getAmount, getAmountFx
* Prototype:
`long getAmount(long transaction);`
* Fixed version prototype:
`fixed getAmountFx(long transaction);`
* Description:
Returns the Signa amount from 'transaction'.
The returned value is the original amount sent minus the activation amount from the contract.
If transaction is invalid, -1 is returned (-0.00000001 in fixed).

### getSender
* Prototype:
`long getSender(long transaction);`
* Description:
Returns the sender's Id from 'transaction'.
If transaction is invalid, 0 is returned.

### getType
* Prototype:
`long getType(long transaction);`
* Description:
Returns the type from 'transaction'.
All transactions types can be fetch at http api [getConstants](https://europe.signum.network/api-doc?requestTag=INFO).
If transaction is invalid, -1 is returned.

### readMessage
* Prototype:
`void readMessage(long transaction, long page, long * buffer);`
* Description:
Reads the incoming message from 'transaction' at 'page' and store it at 'buffer'.
Each page has 32 bytes (4 longs), so the buffer size must be at least 4 longs or the function will overflow the buffer.
First page is 0 and there is no indicator of message size. Control the message expecting zeros after the end of message.
If 'page' is lower than zero or greater than 32, buffer is filled with zeros.
If 'transaction' is invalid or there is no message attached, buffer is filled with zeros.

### readShortMessage
* Prototype:
`void readShortMessage(long transaction, long * buffer, long length);`
* Description:
Reads the first 'length' longs from message of 'transaction' and store it at 'buffer'.
This function only reads the message at page zero.
Ensure the 'buffer' is at least 'length' longs long, or the function will overflow the buffer.
If 'transaction' is invalid or there is no message attached, buffer is filled with zeros.
Limits: 0 <= length <= 4.

### readAssets
* Prototype:
`void readAssets(long transaction, long * buffer);`
* Description:
Reads all assets Id (up to 4) of 'transaction' and store them at 'buffer'.
Four values will be read, so the buffer size must be at least 4 longs or the function will overflow the buffer.
If 'transaction' is invalid, or no assets are found, buffer is filled with zeros.
If less than 4 assets are found, the firsts values will have the assetId and the remaining will be zeros.

### getQuantity
* Prototype:
`long getQuantity(long transaction, long assetId);`
* Description:
Returns the quantity (QNT) of 'assetId' transfered in 'transaction'.

For sending Signa and Messages, only one transaction will be sent each block. The amounts are added.
If 'amount' is greater than contract's current balance, all balance is sent and contract halts execution (no gas).
No empty transactions are sent, they must send at least 1 NQT (or 0.00000001 Signa).

### sendMessage
* Prototype:
`void sendMessage(long * buffer, long accountId);`
* Description:
Enqueues a transaction to send the content of 'buffer' as one message page (32 bytes or 4 longs) to 'accountId'.
Buffer size must be at least 4 longs or the function will overflow reading the buffer.
If the function is used more than once in a block, the messages are concatenated up to 992 bytes (31 pages).
If a 32th page is sent, the first 31 pages are disregarded and the loop restarts.
VERIFY: Transaction is sent with empty message? A empty message is one containing only zeros.

### sendShortMessage
* Prototype:
`void sendShortMessage(long * buffer, long length, long accountId);`
* Description:
Enqueues a transaction to send the content of 'buffer' with 'length' as one message page (32 bytes or 4 longs) to 'accountId'.

* Prototype:
`void sendQuantity(long quantity, long assetId, long accountId);`
* Description:
Sends a transaction to transfer 'quantity' of 'assetId' to 'accountId'.
If contract balance of 'assetId' is lower than 'quantity', all balance of 'assetId' is sent.
If the same asset is transfered two times at same block, their quantities are added and only one transaction is sent.
Transactions from smart contracts can transfer only one asset. If two different assets are transfered in same block, two transactions will be sent.
No empty transactions are sent, they must transfer at least 1 QNT of some asset.

### sendQuantityAndAmount, sendQuantityAndAmountFx
* Prototype:
`void sendQuantityAndAmount(long quantity, long assetId, long amount, long accountId);`
* Fixed version prototype:
`void sendQuantityAndAmountFx(long quantity, long assetId, fixed amount, long accountId);`
* Description:
Sends a transaction to transfer 'quantity' of 'assetId' and 'amount' of Signa to 'accountId'.
This function ensure the asset and Signa are sent in the same transaction and with optimized code.
If 'quantity' is zero no transaction is sent, even if 'amount' is greater than zero.
If contract balance of 'assetId' is lower than 'quantity', all balance of 'assetId' is sent.
If contract balance is lower than 'amount', all Signa balance is sent.
Transactions to transfer assets can not have messages attached.
If the same asset is transfered two times at same block, their quantities are added and only one transaction is sent.
Transactions from smart contracts can transfer only one asset. If two different assets are transfered in same block, two transactions will be sent.

    long quantityToDistribute
);
```
* Fixed version prototype:
```c
void distributeToHoldersFx(
    long holdersAssetMinQuantity,
    long holdersAsset,
    fixed amountToDistribute,
    long assetToDistribute,
    long quantityToDistribute
);
```
* Description:
Distribute the Signa 'amountToDistribute' and 'quantityToDistribute' of 'assetToDistribute' to accounts that hold at least 'holdersAssetMinQuantity' of 'holdersAsset'.
If 'amountToDistribute' and 'quantityToDistribute' are zero, no distribution is done.
Both 'amountToDistribute' and 'quantityToDistribute' can be distributed in same transaction.
Only the free balance is taken in account, this means, if there is quantity in sell orders, they will not be considered.
If current block already has the maximum indirect transactions, no distribution is done.
If no holders have more than the minimum quantity, no distribution is done.
Configured treasury accounts will not join dividends distributed.
The 'assetToDistribute' can be the same as 'holdersAsset' and, in this case, the contract will join the distribution (verify).
